Keys pressed: <up><enter>
singing into ieng6 was 1 up in my history so I hit up then enter to do so

Keys pressed: git clone <control v>
cloned the git file but even though I had deleted the repositary and reforked it I ran into the issue of it still exisiting.
I had not yet edited the files so I could still edit it for the lab report but am wondering how would you delete it from vscode.

Keys pressed: cd lab7 <enter>ls<enter> bash test.sh
changed directory to lab7, ls to check the file names, ran test.sh to run the tests
