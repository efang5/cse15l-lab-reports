Keys pressed: git clone <control v>
cloned the git file but even though I had deleted the repositary and reforked it I ran into the issue of it still exisiting.
I had not yet edited the files so I could still edit it for the lab report but am wondering how would you delete it from vscode.

Keys pressed: cd lab7 <enter>ls<enter> bash test.sh

to run test.sh I just needed to go 4 back in history(note I had to relogin after timing out and having issues because I was previously in ieng-203 which does not have javac enabled)
